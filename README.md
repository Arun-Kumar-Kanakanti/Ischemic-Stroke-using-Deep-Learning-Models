## üß† Ischemic Stroke Prediction

This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of an ischemic stroke based on a variety of medical and demographic features. The primary objective is to enable early intervention by identifying high-risk individuals using machine learning.

### üìå Objective

The goal is to build a predictive model that uses patient data to determine the risk of ischemic stroke. By analyzing patterns in the dataset, the model can assist healthcare professionals in making proactive decisions and potentially saving lives.

### üß¨ Problem Background

An **ischemic stroke** occurs when a blood clot blocks or narrows an artery leading to the brain. It's one of the leading causes of death and disability worldwide. Early detection is crucial, and data-driven approaches like machine learning can play a significant role in prediction and prevention.

### üìä Dataset Overview

The dataset includes anonymized medical records with features known to be associated with stroke risk. Some of the key variables include:

* **Gender**
* **Age**
* **Hypertension**
* **Heart Disease**
* **Marital Status**
* **Work Type**
* **Residence Type (Urban/Rural)**
* **Average Glucose Level**
* **BMI (Body Mass Index)**
* **Smoking Status**
* **Stroke (Target Variable)**
